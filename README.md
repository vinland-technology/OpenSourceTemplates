# OpenSourceTemplates
A set of templates that aim to follow community best practices around
releasing open source software.

The goal of the files in this repo is to provide a starting point for
licensing and coyright texts in source. These files are based on FOSS
license compliance best practices.

Please feel free to use these templates for text and headers in your
own project and feel free to send patches on improvements if you've
got them. Perhaps begin with our CONTRIBUTING.md file?

## Resources

In our example directory we have some examples on how to list
copyright and license on a per-file basis. The examples show the use
of SPDX "short tag" format. SPDX license identifiers for
various licenses are available here; https://spdx.org/licenses/

The Free Software Foundation Europe has created a document on software
reuse that they've contributed to the OpenChain project;
https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/curriculum/blob/master/guides/Reuse-for-OpenChain.md

Another useful resource to attest provenance is the (Developer's Certificate of Origin.)[https://developercertificate.org/]
